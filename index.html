    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
    </center>
    
    1) <span class="highlight">Vision</span>: Create awareness of Blockchain Technology, Cryptocurrencies, NFTs, Web 3.0, etc. among the middle-class Gen X people and the upcoming generations for the welfare of our whole civilization.
    <br><br>

    2) We have seen how investing in Cryptocurrencies can scale up our profits by a huge margin (eg. some people have become crypto billionaires) so, <span class="highlight">we can pull up the people from backward communities / those having low socio-economic status, increase the earnings of middle-class tax bearers</span>, and thus, can bring huge prosperity.
    <br><br>

    3) <span class="highlight">Solution</span>:<br>
    • Create a chatbot that will provide all the information related to the concepts of Web 3.0, the chatbot will be    embedded into a website.<br>
    • The website will be a one-stop destination, the embedded chatbot will act as a service provider where a user can  clear all his doubts, from the basic ones such as what is an investment to the advanced concepts of Crypto mining.<br>
    • The website/chatbot will be accessible to the remote areas where the internet is available (even with high    latency where playing videos is a problem) and people can understand state-of-the-art technology related to finance    i.e. Blockchain in an easy and simple language.<br>
    • <span class="highlight">Azure Services Used</span>: <br>
    a) QnA Maker : To build a Knowledge Base<br>
    b) Azure Bot Service : To create chatbot<br>
    c) Static Web Apps : To host website (chatbot embedded)
    <br><br>

    4) In this project, I am using 3 services provided by <span class="highlight">Microsoft Azure, VS Code, and GitHub</span>. This project mainly will be a solution for the people who are unaware of the potential of Web3, Crypto, etc.
